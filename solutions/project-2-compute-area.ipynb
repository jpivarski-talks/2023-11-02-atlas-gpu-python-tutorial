With 64-bit precision, this takes much longer because the two values must match exactly. If we simply wanted to _draw_ the Mandelbrot set, we could just cut off the number of iterations at, say, 20, but that cut-off has a measurable effect on the area calculation (much more so than 32-bit versus 64-bit).
