1. reverse array multiblock (len == N, use N/256 blocks)

2. filling histogram: by copy and by atomics

3. random numbers estimating pi, Numba's builtin random (https://numba.discourse.group/t/random-number-generation-on-the-gpu/309/4) and using curand_uniform (https://github.com/numba/numba-examples/pull/40)

4. prefix sum -> segment-reduce
